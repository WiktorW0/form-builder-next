[Demo Page](https://form-builder-next-khaki.vercel.app)

***Form Builder is NextJS full stack project shown on [Kliton Bare](https://www.youtube.com/@javascriptmastery) channel.***
</br>

***Form builder, as the name suggests, is an application for building forms and surveys. After logging in using Clerk, the user sees the main dashboard.Here you can see statistics regarding the total number of visits and submissions of all forms/surveys
created by the user and the percentage of visits to the website that resulted submissions and in leaving without interaction (bounce rate).
Here you can create a new form and see all previously created ones that are in the editing stage or have already been published along with individual statistics.***
</br>

***After you create the form, you are redirected to the form designer page. 
Here the user can build his form using the following layout elements:***
- Title field
- Subtitle field
- Paragraph field
- Separator field
- Spacer field

***and form elements:***
- Text field
- Number field
- Text area field
- Date field
- Select field
- Checkbox field

***All elements placed in the sidebar can be dragged and dropped onto the main form designer area. After placing elements in the designer area, the user can select them and edit their properties such as field name, supporting text, additional options, placeholders, number of rows, separator height, etc. Here in the navbar you can choose options to save the designed form and view its final appearance. After the user decides that the form is complete, he can publish it. Therefore, he will go to a page informing about successful publication and a link will be provided that he can use to send the form to others. 
At this point the user can go to the home page or see the submissions of their form. In submission page the user can see the values ‚Äã‚Äãof specific fields in completed forms and statistics on the number of visits, submissions and bounce rate.***

***It was the most extensive project I have ever made, I learned a lot of new things, including how to use shadcn ui, Prisma as ORM, zod validation, dnd kit library, NextJS server actions, Clerk authorization, and I further expanded my knowledge of TypeScript. I spent a lot of time understanding new things because I don't like it when I don't know how something works. It was a really interesting project for me, presented by someone with a lot of experience who didn't waste time explaining why he was doing something, so I learned a lot of things on the fly because I wanted to understand everything.***

***And of course the design is fully responsive. As always, or at least as in most cases.***
